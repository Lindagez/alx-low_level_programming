SEARCHING ALGORITHM
A search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem.
Implementation of diffferent types of searching algorithms and space complexities
The space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input.
